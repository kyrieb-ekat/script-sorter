        distinclty leans traditional st gall but thicker, anticipating the blockier strokes of the later northern german musical script style
    12th century, likely made by the nuns of the double house at Klosterneburg

    Antiphoner; 12th century are featured as interior pastedowns, degraded pieces from an antiphoner in st gall script
