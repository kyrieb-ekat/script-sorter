    Red and yellow stafflines; appears to have some elements in a transitional st gall and later german neume style
        distinclty leans traditional st gall but thicker, anticipating the blockier strokes of the later northern german musical script style
    12th century, likely made by the nuns of the double house at Klosterneburg

## Linz, at-ooElb, hS-290 (Breviarium, 1439, 1310)

    Antiphoner; 12th century are featured as interior pastedowns, degraded pieces from an antiphoner in st gall script
        Probably very good for class 4 noise and odd page appearances, actually. 

## Paris, Compendium antiphonarii ad usum Sancti Martialis Lemovicensis. Latin 1085

    This would be a very hard test for the machine! St Gall on damaged parchment in an unusual format (vertical scroll shape it looks like)
