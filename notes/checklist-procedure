Preprocess Data
    Use the preprocess_data.py script to split the raw dataset into training, validation, and test sets:
        python preprocess_data.py
Confirm that the train, validation, and test directories are correctly populated.


Model Training
    Train Initial Model
        Use the train_model.py script to train the VGG16 model:
            python train_model.py
        Save the trained model to /models/vgg16_initial.h5.

    Fine-Tune the Model (Optional)
        After initial training, modify the train_model.py script to unfreeze some layers of VGG16.
        Retrain the model with a lower learning rate and save it as /models/vgg16_finetuned.h5.

Model Evaluation
    Evaluate on Test Set
        Run evaluate_model.py to evaluate the model on unseen test images:
            python evaluate_model.py
    Verify results:
        Classification Report: Check /results/classification_report.txt.
        Confusion Matrix: View /results/confusion_matrix.png.

Inference
    Classify New Images
        Use predict_image.py to classify individual images:
            python predict_image.py --image /path/to/image.jpg
    Confirm the predicted class and confidence score.

Refinements and Next Steps

    Enhance Data Preparation
        Ensure robust data augmentation is applied in train_model.py.
        Consider increasing the dataset size by including more samples or using synthetic data.

    Track Metrics
        Review metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.
        Adjust the training process based on insights (e.g., handling class imbalance).

    Document the Experiment
        Update README.md with:
            Objectives
            Data preprocessing methods
            Model architecture and training details
            Results and observations
